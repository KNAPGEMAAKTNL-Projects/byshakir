# VIBE MANIFESTO: By Shakir

## The Competitive Edge

While local competitors in the Gelderland region act as "furniture retailers" (brightly lit, cluttered, focused on individual product prices), **By Shakir** will position itself as an **International Design Authority**. By utilizing a "Dark Mode" aesthetic and cinematic motion, we immediately signal that this is not a shop for browsing, but a destination for serious investment. We borrow the "Metropolitan Luxury" visual language of national leaders (like Eric Kuster) but add the intimate, bespoke service layer of a boutique studio. The site will feel less like a catalog and more like a private viewing.

## The Feeling

The site should feel like walking into a 5-star hotel suite in Dubai at night: dimly lit, perfectly quiet, and undeniably expensive. It is confident enough to whisper. The user should feel a sense of **exclusivity** and **calm**. There is no rush to "Add to Cart"; there is only the invitation to upgrade one's lifestyle. It’s the digital equivalent of a heavy velvet curtain being pulled back.

## Visual Direction

### Photography & Imagery

**Approach:** "Cinematic Interior."

* **Do:** Use the slow-motion video loop in the hero to set the pace. Images should be "low-key" (shadowy, dramatic lighting) rather than bright real-estate style photos.
* **Context:** Furniture is never shown in isolation. A sofa is shown with a rug, a coffee table, and art—selling the *scene*, not the SKU.
* **People:** If Shakir appears, it is in black-and-white or desaturated tones, working or inspecting materials—the "Master at Work."

### Typography Feel

**Personality:** "Editorial Elegance."

* **Headlines:** A sharp, high-contrast Serif font (e.g., *Playfair Display*, *Bodoni*, or *Cinzel*). It should feel like the masthead of a luxury fashion magazine.
* **Body Text:** A clean, geometric Sans-Serif (e.g., *Montserrat* or *Lato*) with generous letter spacing (tracking) to ensure legibility against dark backgrounds.

### Color Philosophy

**Palette:** "Metropolitan Night."

* **Background:** Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) or Rich Black (#050505). *Never* pure white.
* **Accents:** Muted Gold, Bronze, or Champagne (#C5A059). Used sparingly for lines, buttons, or key highlights.
* **Text:** Off-white/Light Grey (#E0E0E0) to reduce eye strain while maintaining contrast.

### Space & Rhythm

**Pacing:** "Slow & Deliberate."

* Give the content room to breathe. Wide margins.
* We are not trying to cram information above the fold. The user is expected to scroll slowly to appreciate the details.

### Motion & Interaction

**Dynamism:** "The Slow Reveal."

* **Hero:** The video background plays smoothly with a dark overlay.
* **Scroll:** Elements should fade in upwards (*fade-up*) slowly as the user scrolls.
* **Hover:** Images zoom in slightly and slowly (scale 1.05) on hover. No jarring, fast movements.
* **Parallax:** Subtle parallax on full-width background images to create depth.

## Conversion Architecture

### Hero Strategy

**Goal:** Immersion & Validation.

* **Visual:** Full-screen video background (Bedroom project).
* **Text:** Minimal. "Metropolitan Luxury Interiors."
* **Sub-text:** "Tiel | Dubai | Malaga" (Establishing international reach immediately).
* **Action:** No aggression. A simple ghost button: "Explore Collections" or "The Studio."

### Trust Progression

**Order of Operations:**

1. **Visual Proof:** The video (Immediate "Wow").
2. **Social Proof:** Subtle text ("International Projects realized in...").
3. **The Person:** A section introducing Shakir to ground the luxury in reality.
4. **The Action:** The invitation to the showroom.

### CTA Philosophy

**Tone:** "Exclusive Invitation."

* Avoid generic "Contact Us" or "Buy Now."
* Use phrases like: *"Request a Consultation,"* *"Plan a Showroom Visit,"* or *"Inquire."*
* Buttons should be outlined (Ghost buttons) or solid gold/bronze, elegant and understated.

## What This Site is NOT

* **NOT a Webshop:** No "Add to Cart" icons visible on the main browsing pages. No "$999" price tags sticking out.
* **NOT a Local Furniture Store:** No "Sale" banners, no "Open on Sundays" generic text in the header.
* **NOT Cluttered:** No sidebars, no dense blocks of text. If it doesn't add to the luxury feel, delete it.
* **NOT "Chatty":** No floating WhatsApp bubbles bouncing in the corner distractions.

## The Success Test

> "If a potential client opens a local competitor's site and **By Shakir** side-by-side, the competitor should look like a **store** where they buy a chair, while By Shakir looks like a **partner** who will design their life."
